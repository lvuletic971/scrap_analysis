BI & Visualization

This folder contains analytical dashboards created in Tableau
for exploring manufacturing waste and production efficiency.

The visualizations are built on top of the data warehouse model
and focus on identifying trends, root causes, and key performance indicators
related to production waste.

Key Analytical Insights

The dashboards highlight several important findings:

Waste shows a strong increasing trend over the observed years,
even when overall production slightly decreases.

Certain products generate disproportionately high waste,
indicating potential process or quality issues rather than production volume.

Finished products produce more waste than semi-finished products,
suggesting problems in the final production stages.

The dominant root cause of waste is related to technical factors and machinery,
pointing to potential equipment maintenance or replacement needs.

The waste percentage exceeds the acceptable 1% threshold in later years,
signaling declining production efficiency.

Purpose of the BI Layer

The BI layer enables:

monitoring of waste trends over time

identification of high-risk products and processes

analysis of root causes of waste

tracking of key production efficiency KPIs

These insights support data-driven operational and strategic decisions
in manufacturing.
