FactPromet – ETL process

The ETL process for FactPromet prepares and loads manufacturing transaction data into the central fact table of the data warehouse.

The process begins with an Execute SQL Task that ensures the target fact table structure is ready for loading.
This is followed by a Data Flow Task where production and waste transactions are extracted, transformed, and merged into a unified analytical dataset.

Data source – transaction tables

Production and waste information is extracted from:

Production transaction records

Waste (scrap) transaction records

Supporting lookup tables for errors, causes, dates, products, and production processes

These datasets are first prepared in a staging database to avoid performance impact on the operational system.

Transformations

Key transformations in the Data Flow include:

Separation of waste vs. regular production transactions

Aggregation of produced quantities and waste amounts

Joining staging datasets to align production and scrap by
date, document, and product

Lookup transformations for:

Product dimension

Date dimension

Production process dimension

Error type and error cause dimensions

Handling of missing matches and default values

Calculation of analytical measures:

Produced quantity

Waste quantity

Waste percentage

Waste value

Goal

The final goal of this ETL process is:

➡️ Populating the FactPromet table
➡️ Providing a clean, aggregated, analysis-ready dataset
➡️ Enabling time-series, product-level, and root-cause waste analysis in BI tools.
